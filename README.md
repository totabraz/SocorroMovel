# Socorro Model - "Seguran√ßa Digital"
App developed on Hackathon RN Digital (Campus Party Natal 2018)
Themes: Security, Education and Hydric Resources.

At Security theme we won as first, and at the general of this Hackathon we won as the Third.

My team: 
Me - Mobile Developer
Rayssa Cunha - Webservices 
(but we didn't use It, Webserves and Firebase don't comunicate so well, becouse they break the function "Real Time Database" from Firebase)
Tadeu - Graduating law school - support if we had any doubt
